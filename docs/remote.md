## Install

Download [Remote](https://github.com/wizzomafizzo/mrext/releases/latest/download/remote.sh) and copy it to the `Scripts` folder on your MiSTer's SD card.

Optionally, add the following to the `downloader.ini` file on your MiSTer, to receive updates with the `update` script:
```
[mrext/remote]
db_url = https://github.com/wizzomafizzo/mrext/raw/main/releases/remote/remote.json
```

Once installed, run `remote` from the MiSTer `Scripts` menu, and a prompt will offer to enable Remote as a startup service.

This service must be running for remote to work, but it has no impact on your MiSTer's performance.

## Usage

From a web browser, navigate to `http://<mister_ip>:8182` to access Remote. The `remote` app in the `Scripts` menu will display the exact address to use if you're not sure.

## Uninstall

After opening `remote` from the `Scripts` menu, there is an option available to uninstall Remote called `Uninstall`. You can also run `remote.sh -uninstall` from the console or via SSH.

### Manual

To manually uninstall Remote from your MiSTer, delete these files from the SD card:

* `Scripts/remote.sh`
* `Scripts/remote.ini` (if present)
* `search.db` (this file is also used by Search if you have it installed)

If you have an active wallpaper set by Remote, you will also need to remove `menu.png` or `menu.jpg`. These are just links to the actual file in the `wallpapers` folder.

Finally, remove the following lines from `linux/user-startup.sh`:
```
# mrext/remote
[[ -e /media/fat/Scripts/remote.sh ]] && /media/fat/Scripts/remote.sh -service $1
```
